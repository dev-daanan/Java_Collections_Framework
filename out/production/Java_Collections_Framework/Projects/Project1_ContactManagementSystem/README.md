### Project 1: Contact Management System

Implement a contact management system using various Collection classes. The system should have the capability to:

- **Add new contacts:** Name, Phone Number, Email, etc.
- **Search contacts:** By name, email, etc.
- **Modify contacts:** Change phone number, email, etc.
- **Delete contacts**

Use ArrayList to store contacts and HashMap to store a mapping from contact names to their respective details for efficient search. Also, consider implementing features like sorting contacts alphabetically, which would allow you to use and understand Comparator/Comparable.
